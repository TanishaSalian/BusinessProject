I have super oily skin, but with dry patches around my nose and dehydration. This “moisturizer” does not do a good job at all at moisturizing. When you put it on, it is very smooth and makes your skin feel nice, but that’s it. It’s more of a “skin smoother” than a moisturizer, I feel like it doesn’t penetrate or moisturizer at all.

I get very oily on my forehead, nose, chin, smile lines, and occasionally cheeks. I find that using this in the morning right after I wash my face and tone really helps with my makeup application. Generally, I mainly only use this product in the morning because at night I apply a Vitamin E oil to my face. Do not think that you need to use a lot of this to cover your entire face, 1 and a half pumps is really all you need. I prefer to blend my moisturizer in with a brush and I find that using that method with this moisturizer really ensures that all the product has been rubbed into my skin properly. I have been using this moisturizer for 4 years and I go through about 2 bottles a year. It really is a good investment into your skin.

I have literally tired everything...proactiv, over the counter topical products, as well as numerous face washes and leave on spot treatments. All of the above would either work for a while, or actually make my skin more sensitive and inflamed. A couple years ago my mom recommended Clinique’s face makeup to me, and I decided to buy this product along with their foundation. After a week of washing my face twice a day and using a couple of pumps this gel afterwards, my skin issues virtually vanished. I no longer struggle with painful, deep cystic breakouts along my chin, jawline, and on my cheeks, and the redness in my skin had greatly diminished as well. I ACTUALLY get compliments on my skin, where I never have before. This product leaves my skin feeling moisturized and cool; not like many other moisturizers which tend to leave skin feeling greasy, and heavy. Your skin will literally drink this gel, and thank you for it! One tip I have for people who really struggle with sensitive, acne ridden skin is to use this product in conjunction with Glam Glow’s SUPERCLEANSE Clearing Cream-to-Foam Cleanser. There must be something about the combination of high quality ingredients and the fact that both products have been formulated for sensitive skin, that makes this combination such a winner for acne prone skin. Either way, buy this moisturizing gel, and I promise that you won’t be disappointed with the results- clear, even, beautiful skin :)",Solved my acne problems for good...,fairLight,hazel,combination,brown,P122900,Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel,CLINIQUE,32.5

I had stopped using moisturizer for YEARS because everything clogged my pores, irritated my skin, or caused a layer of sebum to form on my face. This stuff does no such thing!!! My Clinique consultant introduced this to me and I absolutely love it. It’s everything you want from a moisturizer: non-greasy, oil-free, soaks evenly into skin, cooling and soothing, and makes your skin baby-soft! It’s also evened out my usually pale-pink complexion and never irritated my skin. I now have no more bumps or red patches. It’s also a great addition to a flawless beauty routine! I would recommend one thing to people who use this for the first time though: cleanse your face and start with a little less than a pea-sized amount! This moisturizer goes VERY far and if you overdo it you may not like the way it feels and also waste moisturizer. I only use about a pea-sized amount every day total, and that’s for both my morning and evenign skincare routine!",GAME CHANGER!!!

It is perfect. Just a perfect amount of hydration and soaks in super quick. I usually just use my regular face moisturizer for under my eyes, but with this gel i had to use something with more hydration in it for under my eyes. It doesnt bother me at all because my face feels so good all day and my makeup applies beautifully on top of this.   My favorite thing about this gel is how lightweight it feels after applying.

I mean i feel like i have baby skin ( duh!! ) It has been only 3 days so I don’t have much to say about the long term result, but I like it so much that I have to sign up and write my first review. I think the result is best when used with the 2 other steps ( face soap and clarifying lotion ). But it worked just fine when used alone.And one more thing, Im glad I got this gel one instead of the lotion one because it absorbs very fast and does not feel sticky at all.",My skin never felt this good,,,combination,,P122900,Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel,CLINIQUE,32.5

I wanted to like it: unscented, great reviews, etc. but it wasn’t that great for me. When I first put some on my fingers, the consistency was very loose and liquidly. Then I put it all over my face and it took awhile to work in to my face. After a while, it started to absorb into my skin but it left my face oily but then sticky/tacky once it dried. I’m a guy so finding a working, unscented, and natural moisturizer is hard to come by, especially for my dry/combination skin. I could see how this could work for people who wear daily makeup, because once it drys, it is very matte. But for me, it left my face oily but then sticky/tacky once it dried.

I remembered that at one point, I had really liked the lotion, and for this great price, I would give the gel a shot. I am SO glad I did! This gel gives just the right amount of moisture, doesn’t dry out my skin, and feels so light and smooth! A little goes a long way with this as well; two pumps and I am good to go! I especially love the pump because I hate dipping my fingers(and long nails) into my moisturizer jar every morning.

In hot, humid summer, this may be all the skin needs. However, in the winter, its moisturizing power is lacking -people with combination skin with dry areas on the cheeks will notice. Additionally, it actually does not help with the oiliness of my skin and, paradoxically, using a more moisturizing cream or mixing the gel with a cream helped with excess oil. There is a unique factor to this product which, despite the above problem, makes this gel unique. It smooths out the skin. Right after applying the gel the skin is smoother, which is why I continue to use it alongside other creams.Whether to purchase this gel depends on the person’s needs and skin. For me, it did not combat the oiliness of the T-zone and seemed to make it worse, though the smoothing properties of the gel are something to think about.

I love it when I’m getting ready in the morning because I’m often rushing and don’t have time to sit around and wait for moisturizers to soak in. After putting this on I’m ready to apply my makeup less than five minutes later. It is also the perfect moisturizer to use for nights out because there is no SPF, so no annoying whitecast flashbacks in photos. This is truly an amazing and unique moisturizer that is also very reasonably priced. I’m so glad that my perfect moisturizer is not only effective, but also relatively inexpensive compared to other high-end brands.

But Clinique has always priced their products decently, so on a whim I picked up the travel size of this while standing in line one day. The timing was perfect. I was looking for something that would moisturize my face without contributing to the oil production and this gel is definitely it, plus the price tag was just right. I use it morning and night after washing my face with a cleanser and it gives me just enough moisture to keep my skin soft without looking like an oil slick. I can even wake up in the morning and put off washing my face for a few hours if I happen to be lounging around the house. Before, I would get that nasty grimy feeling from the oil building up. Yuck!

I like to keep mine in the refrigerator or mini fridge - the temperature of my room is really hot since I live upstairs and it will get extra runny is I don’t keep it in the fridge. The consistency is still runny regardless - it is more of liquidy gel than an actual gel. Also, I have very sensitive skin that tends to - dry out, get red, or break out. But this product did not break me out. It actually helped when I was going through a really mad skin faze after it had gotten irritated after using a bad scrub. It did sting a pinch because my skin was so raw at the time. But now that my skin is much better - it does not sting at all, just a light cooling feeling and a matte texture. One thing - it doesn’t moisturize very dry spots, if you are only a little dry then it should be sufficient but otherwise you will need something more moisturizing for those tough spots.This is definitely a good buy if you are normal or oily or even if you have breakouts. Just don’t use toner or astringent too often as it can cause your skin to get more sensitive, just have a good face wash and moisturizer and masks.

I can tell this moisturizer is expensive--the silicone in it feels good on my skin, but since it is completely oil-free and light, it ends up not moisturizing at all.Your skin is oily because it isn’t moisturized--since we wash our faces so much, chemically stripping them of their natural oils, I’ve come to realize oily skin actually NEEDS moisture/some oil. Although this moisturizer feels nice, it makes my nose super oily since it doesn’t moisturize, causing my face to produce lots of oil because of a complete lack of any oil whatsoever. However, this moisturizer does not help my dry cheeks either (I have combination skin). A small amount of the right type of oil will actually help oily skin be less oily.

I actually stay shine-free all day with this, which feels like a miracle to me. This leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft, not at all oily, greasy, or like you have too thick of a moisturizer on.

I’ve been using it since December until now and I have to say that while I do like it, I don’t love it. I thought it was amazing until recently when I tried the Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief. The dramatically different moisturizing gel (DDMG for short) feels like a very lightweight lotion. It absorbs readily and quickly into the skin. I really like that aspect of the DDMG but it honestly does not moisturize my skin that much. Oftentimes, I feel like my skin is very oily because it is dehydrated due to the acne products I use (which I only use once a day). So I want a moisturizer that absorbs readily, feels lightweight, yet hydrates at the same time. The DDMG didn’t hydrate my skin very well. I tried increasing the amount I was applying to my face - usually I use 1 pump but lately I have been using 1 1/2 pumps - and it feels somewhat hydrated. So I would say that this helps with my oilyness a little bit but not enough. This is an okay product but for dehydrated skin that becomes oily throughout the day, I would recommend the Clinique Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief instead. If your skin only needs a little bit of moisture or simply a lightweight moisturizer for the summertime, then this product will probably work better for you.For the price, you get a large amount of product that should last several months so it’s definitely a good value.

The Moisturizing Gel is great for both cold and warm seasons. It’s not too sticky and is developed for naturally oily skin. It naturally balances the moisture levels on your skin, making it smooth and comfortable. So when the skin becomes too dry, the system will add more moisture, as well as soften and smooth out the texture of your skin.After using this product, I saw a reduction in redness and dryness of my skin. There is no more flakiness and the natural oils of my skin are balanced off well so there is not an excessive amount of shine/oils produced. This is also great as a base for your make-up. Before applying a primer, apply a nice moisturizing gell so your skin feels healthy and protected.I bought this bottle in the beginning of June 2010 and use it twice a day everyday. Two pumps is all you nee for your entire face. As you can see I’ve started to run low so I had bought a back up for when my bottle runs out.

I have been using Proactiv religiously twice a day every day for about two-three weeks, which has severely dried out my lids and neck, as well as some patches on my face and around my nose. I noticed it yesterday and realized that this was so bad for you! Dry skin makes for wrinkles and I definitely don’t want wrinkles on my eyes and neck (I’m only 23 but hey I want to get an early start!) So I read really good reviews about this moisturizer. I’m really weary about moisturizers and don’t really use them unless i need them. Previously I had been using Jergens gradual tanning moisturizer but noticed it left my already acne prone somewhat oily face even more greasy, so I would only use it every once in a while. Anyway, so I read really good reviews about this moisturizer and read that it does well with skin like mine. I’ve only used it twice a day for about two days and I must say it feels really good! I also didn’t notice a scent at all. It’s very humid here in South Texas and though it hasn’t gotten as hot as it will probably get this summer, I don’t think this moisturizer has made my face very oily at all! I’ve only had to blot once today and reapply my mineral veil and that has really done the job. I wish there was SPF in it though, but I get that with my BE foundation (SPF 15). I also used this as a primer this morning becuase while BE’s Prime Time does an excellent job, I think that is what has made me break out so badly. Anyway, I’m really impressed with this moisturizer and the amount of product you get. For $24 it’s a little pricey, but for a good quality moisturizer that’ll last a good while, I think that’s a good deal. I’m probably going to have to use it for a few more days to get rid of the dryness on my eyelids and neck, but that’s to be expected.

If you have sensitive skin like I do, I would steer clear of the exfoliating wipes from Sephora. Overall, I think these are great products especially for the price. Just be cautious when ordering and using the exfoliating wipes on sensitive skin.","Overall great, but sensitive skin be cautious",light,blue,combination,brown,P409800,Cleansing & Exfoliating Wipes,SEPHORA COLLECTION,3.0

I wipe my face with the soft side, then gently scrub my face in a circle motion all around about 5 times or as much as I think I need it depending on how much makeup I wore that day. Then I go back over it again with the soft side and it’s like I’ve had a professional facial! I haven’t tried any of the other scents/formulas, but this papaya one does exactly what it says- BRIGHTENS. My face is bright and so smooth! It even feels like I put a serum or moisturizer on because my face feels silky! I’m sold, I have to keep repurchasing but not sure yet if I’ll try a different one.

The sheet has a nice balance of moisture/product. Enough to do the job, but not over saturated and slimey and leaving the feeling like I had to wash my face after using it. The cloth is also sooooo soft. It wasn’t scratchy or rough on my face like other wipes I’ve used in the past.

Normally, I use them to remove my makeup before actually washing my face with a cleanser, but sometimes when I’m feeling lazy I can get away with just using one of these wipes. They do a really nice job of removing my makeup (face and eyes), and don’t leave me feeling dry afterwards. In fact, I normally don’t even need to moisturize if I’m just using the wipe to cleanse, they provide just enough moisture and leave your skin soft and bright. I do have extremely reactive, sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts with almost every product I use, but these have yet to cause any negative reactions. Personally, I wouldn’t rely on them as your sole cleanser but they are definitely great for removing makeup or making your life easier on those nights when you’re too tired for your full skincare routine.

Sephora’s exfoliating tissue wipes is not only affordable but their quality exceeds my expectations in comparison to any other brands of facial wipes I’ve  used. The one that I got was the pineapple one and it smells incredible like freshly cut juicy pineapple. In fact, the exfoliating wipe itself was so “juicy” or moister compared to other facial wipes I’ve used, that I could’ve sworn I was wiping pineapple juice on my face to remove makeup. The other benefit of these wipes is that it has two sides: an exfoliating sides which is grainy and almost sugar-like (no ants I promised) and the other is just the regular wipe. Combining these together not only help with eliminating makeups but it also exfoliate and scrub dead skin as well which I believe is a plus, and after rinsing it off, my face feels smooth, healthy, and there’s a lingering pleasant smell of pineapple as well which makes me happy.

It left my skin feeling fresh and I noticed that my skin is less oily and there’s improvement with my pores! Sadly, l found out that they have discontinued this product so I decided to get this clensing wipes instead. It’s very convenient since you don’t need cotton pads. Unlike other pre-moistened wipes, it has a snap cover to keep the moist. Works the same as the micellar water but more convenient. The price point is very good.

The first thing I noticed with these was the smell. It was terrible. Way too strong and perfumey. Like they tried to cover the smell of the cleansers with it. Trying to get past that, I wiped my face. The exfoliating beads on it were sooo incredibly rough. It actually hurt to wipe my face. Of course I wasn’t being rough or wiping too hard, but it didn’t matter. I don’t have sensitive skin but it definitely hurt and turned my skin red for a while. Between that and the smell that lasts quite a while, I couldn’t use them. I ended up wiping down my vanity with them so it didn’t go to waste.

Read my review after you’ve already hit the “checkout“ button. DO IT NOW! Lol. I’ve tried tons of makeup wipes over the years and, honestly, none have impressed me at all. Either they left a sticky residue, or they left behind mascara or eyeliner, or left my sensitive skin dry and tight. I’ve tried cheap ones and expensive ones and was always left wanting. Recently, I got tired of having to head to the bathroom to wash my face with cleanser after a long day of work. I just wanted to be able to grab a wipe or two and clean my face while watching Netflix with my feet up. I was tired of rushing through my boring cleansing routine and just wanted to do it slowly while relaxing. So I browsed around Sephora and saw the glowing reviews for these wipes and decided to try them. As planned, I tried them while watching Netflix. (Season 8 of RuPaul’s Drag Race is life!!) With almost no effort and definitely no tugging, my mascara and eyeliner wiped off completely. I wiped off my tinted brow gel with the same side. Then I flipped over and got all the rest. After 3 or 4 relaxing minutes, my face was spotless and felt so smooth and balanced, with a hint of pomegranate fragrance. I couldn’t believe that one single cloth could do all that!I want to try the other kinds but they’re all sold out. So I’ve re-purchased several of the the pomegranate and will be waiting anxiously for the rest to come back in stock.

So, when I saw the Green Tea and Charcoal wipes, I was super interested. A Sephora employee recommended the Green Tea wipes; he explained that the green tea would help mattify and treat my skin even in a wipe while the charcoal wouldn’t do much as charcoal works best in masks where it can sit on the face and draw out impurities. I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical that a wipe would do much of anything, but I’m pleasantly surprised. I found that these wipes helped de-slick and refreshed my face, and the exfoliating side is great (as long as you don’t scrub too hard, I learned this the hard way). It did a good job removing my face makeup.

When I saw these I first inspected the ingredients to make sure they didn’t have anything offensive and they check out for my concerns. I tried the rose, coconut, pomegranate and charcoal. I had very low expectations and WOW am I happy I tried them. Coconut: perfectly mild, I love it for all over my face and it removes eye makeup surprisingly well. My fiancé likes these ones and keeps them in his car for after surfing. Rose: OMG I’m obsessed with these. This was a surprise to me, because I thought they would smell like artificial perfumey-rose smell but no, these smell like fresh cut roses.  Not kidding. I never like rose scented products because I’m sensitive to strong floral perfume but these are so light fresh and delicious.  I know this isn’t the intended use but I use the rose wipes to freshen my underarms mid day since I don’t use deodorant (I’m vegan & gluten free so I no longer have BO but sometimes I cheat and have a piece of bread and the next few days have a sight odor) these cleanse my skin and leave me smelling so clean and lovely. No deodorant needed. Charcoal: super exfoliating texture on the wipe. Like, almost too rough but useful if you are wanting that. I wouldn’t use these daily, as it would be too exfoliating and would leave my skin raw, but a few times a week especially on my nose I love these. Pomegranate: yet another scent that took me pleasantly by surprise. I absolutely love the clean soft delicious scent. After being highly impressed by the delicate scent and cleansing ability of every one I tried I would highly recommend trying any that catch your eye. These are my new must-have staple.",Addicted!

In most cases, this is from the air or water ontop of the skin. If you apply this to dry skin, chances are that the humectants will actually pull water from the deeper layers of your skin, which can cause dehydration problems.

It’s thick but I personally like that and it sinks in fairly quickly with no sticky residue. Whatever is left over I rub on my hands and they’ve stopped cracking. I didn’t even buy it for that but it’s a nice side effect. I had a fine line on my forehead that has gone away.

I’ll be leaving this same review on all 4 if The Ordinary that I use consistently; Hyaluronic Acid, Retinoids, Salicylic Acid, & Lactic Acid. Before using The Ordinary I had a list of issues with my skin; intense dry patches, small bumps, scarring, intense painful acne that just would not go away. I tried many paths, products and treatments to improve my skin and comfort and unfortunately nothing seemed to help.After about 1.5 months of continuous use of the ordinary my skin started to slowly change. The Ordinary products are wonderful, simple, no added unnecessary fillers/scents, ethical, and my favourite company. One of the only company’s I’ve remained loyal to because I respect their products and what they stand for. The Ordinary isn’t an end all be all, or a quick fix! Please take care of yourself. I’ve also worked on a lot of life issues, try to keep my stress low, take better care of myself and not overwhelm myself when I am able. I will say that in addition to all of this I don’t believe the drastic and intense changes in my skin are massive and I don’t believe they would’ve been possible without this brand. I’ve shared The Ordinary with friends, family, and clients. It’s affordable, simple, and wonderful. PHOTOS above are before I used the ordinary and after 7.5 consistent months of use. It’s taken me time and research to find which products are most beneficial to me! ☺️ There’s so much helpful info and videos from dermatologists on this brand and how to use these products, also suggestions on which will be best. Everyone I’ve introduced it to adores their products, I’ve never received so many compliments on my skin. (I’m my second photo I am only wearing a couple dots of concealer.

I even use it on my knuckles sometimes, when they get SUPER dry from washing my hands in the winter and doing dishes, before applying hand lotion and it makes a world of difference like you wouldn’t believe- even if that’s not a traditional use for it. Your face will thank you for this! Just be careful what products you pair it with- I’ve noticed that it works differently with different face washes and lotions. Either way, it’s worth it.

However I think some of the reviewers on here my not be using it correctly. This product is hydrophilic meaning it loves water. It uses that water to penetrate into your skin and give your skin that plump look. Therefore this product needs to be used with damp skin. If you dry your face thoroughly & then apply it, it will not have water to help it absorb into your skin. So it will sit on top of your skin and cause piling. Also once the product absorbs all the water underneath your skin it will help with tightening and plumping and in order to seal in that plumpness you need a good moisturizer to seal it in. So first wash face with a damp skin then apply this product, once dry and absorbed add your moisturizer and then add a mineral sunscreen over the moisturizer.

After over a week of using though I started to get really bad blackhead breakouts on my nose and cheeks. So I had to stop using it. Not sure why the reaction with my pores as it’s oil free not greasy at all and absorbed really well into my skin. So I keep it but now I mainly use it on my cuticles now.

(Important! Make sure face is damp when applying HA so it can work it’s hydrating magic!) - Allow to dry for one full minute before moving on to my next serums. Once applied my skin feels completely hydrated, looks dewy (but feels dry to touch) and has the perfect blank canvas to receive the next batch of products. The packaging and dropper application is beautiful and easy to use and control how much HA is coming out. If you have a skincare fridge, pop this baby in there to have cold HA to apply to your face. (Not necessary but an EXTRA step if you’re feeling EXTRA - which I usually am!) (Your kitchen fridge works too!) TLDR; Buy this product! You won’t be disappointed and your skin will rejoice in all its hydrated bliss.",Must have in Skincare Arsenal!!,medium,brown,combination,black,P427419,Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum,The Ordinary,15.7

In the beginning, I used it night and day, on a dry face, but when I saw no change I asked around and learned that I should apply it on a damp face to activate it. Hyaluronic acid absorbs moisture from its surroundings into the skin, so if you apply it on damp skin, it will absorb the water. After I started using it like this, and only using it in the morning, I saw a difference. My main concerns were my enlarged pores on my nose and some breakouts on the forehead, and my forehead cleared up a little. I used this product with the 10% niacinamide + 1% zinc syrum and I think they helped each other clear up my skin!

I tend to get oily in my T-zone but very dry around my mouth, but I haven’t had many issues with that since I’ve started using hyaluronic acid.I’m no skin expert by any means, but some tips I learned that helped me to use this product more effectively: (1) mix a few drops with your moisturizer and apply to wet or damp skin. Hyaluronic acid is a humectant so it works best when it has some kind of moisture to bind with. (2) If you layer other products on top of your hyaluronic acid, you should wait a few minutes between products to give them each time to absorb. I also experienced the little flakes that many people complain about here when I first tried to layer rosehip oil with this, but a little internet search helped me realize that you just need to give each product a few minutes to sink in so that it doesn’t flake up. (3) Since we’re all (hopefully) washing our hands a lot, some of you who have sensitive skin like me might be experiencing breakouts on your hands. Hyaluronic acid has been great for healing scales and rashes on my skin, so if you get rashes on other parts of your body, maybe try applying a little hyaluronic acid to see if it heals it.

I’d been using a Japanese brand of HA for years, but it isn’t always available online and is generally hard to get here in Canada, so I thought I’d try out The Ordinary’s HA, and I’ve never been so disappointed in a product in my life. It’s sticky, it’s thick, and it ALWAYS pilled underneath my moisturiser, no matter how little I applied. And don’t even get me started on how it made my foundation look!! So patchy, pilly, and just straight-up ugly. I tried so many times to love this product, but every single time I would end up having to wash it off before leaving the house because it just looked *bad*. I can’t even comment on the effect it had on my skin, because I couldn’t bear to keep it on long enough for it to make a difference.It took about two weeks of troubleshooting this product before I gave up and decided to go back to my tried and true. In comparison, the Japanese brand is soo light and thin. It soaks in right away, and I can apply layer after layer with absolutely no pilling. It is truly a holy grail product, and The Ordinary’s version will unfortunately never compare :(Maybe I would’ve liked it more if I didn’t have anything else to compare it to, but once you’ve experienced perfection you just can’t go back.",possibly The Ordinary's worst product ever,light,hazel,combination,brown,P427419,Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum,The Ordinary,15.7

For me, if it works, no expense is worth sparing. After reading up, I decided to buy 4 products from The Ordinary in replacement of my current skincare. At first I was skeptical, as I started use after a major breakout from both acne and melasma dark spots (I have incredibly sensitive skin, and as an adult it’s hard to find anything gentle, yet strong enough to work). After my skin adjusted to any sensitivity within a few days, this product (daily use), paired with their “Vitamin C Suspension“ (nightly use - and I think the real hero here), Caffeine solution (night/day for eyes), and Salicylic Acid Masque (weekly use) COMPLETELY cleared my skin. I have never had that result even using $100+ serums, no less in the middle of a no-forgiveness humid summer.

It can be used day or night, and interacts well with many other products. It’s quite inexpensive which is also a huge bonus. I took away one star for the texture of the product, that is just personal preferences. When you apply to skin if you used circular motions to “rub” into skin, it gets slightly frothy and increasingly tackier. I apply 4 drops to face, and will only swipe in one motion to move around my face. I find that helps with the tacky feeling. I see some comments that it flaked, or not to wear under makeup.

I apply the Hyaluronic Acid directly onto my wet face, and often follow up with a thermal water spray. I allow to the product to naturally do its thing, then once dry I follow up with a moisturizer. Make sure you’re following up with a moisturizer!!!Also hyaluronic acid should be used in climates that are NOT dry! So if your environment is already not humid, you’re probably not going to reap the benefits of this thing.. It may even do the opposite of what you’re wanting it to do because HA pulls water from the air and if there’s no water.. well you get the picture!Living in a humid place, and also pairing it with this method of application, my skins definitely more plumper, hydrated, and happy :)",Ideal for humid places & apply on wet face!,medium,brown,combination,black,P427419,Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum,The Ordinary,15.7

It makes this $7 bottle really really worth it. I’ve bought it on and off a few times over the years but I’ve only now figured out how to properly utilize it. This serum can act all sorts of ways depending on the way I apply it. It can become sticky, it can emulsify and become tacky, and it ball up like a peeling solution, and it dry on top of the skin without absorbing creating a very dry look, and it can create a plastic like film on top of the skin.

This is how I apply this particular Hyaluronic acid to my skin:**On DAMP SKIN** this is either damp from previously washing my face, or splashed with water, orr spritzed with a face refresher like a toner or those aerosol water spritz thingys. Use the dropper to pour a small amount, approx pearl sized, and I SPREAD it across my hands. I do not rub or ‘warm up’ or use any rotating movements, I simply spread the product by gliding my hands across one another (imagine brushing crumbs off your hands or something). This spreading motion is how I apply it to my face as well. I do NOT RUB this product in, I do NOT USE CIRCULAR MOTION to rub it in. Simply spread it evenly across my face and then with my whole hand I press it into my skin until it feels warm. My face usually still feels a bit damp which is what I want, I immediately apply my moisturizer which is Cerave and that locks in the water absorption. My skin is immediately plump hydrated and even toned. **BONUS HYDRATION if you apply this in a steamy room i.e. after you shower and your bathroom is still steamed up.",How to make this bottle WORTH IT’S $7 cost,tan,brown,combination,black,P427419,Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum,The Ordinary,15.7

When I tried it with my nightly skin routine, I woke up with patches of my skin peeling, which is abnormal for me. I thought maybe my skincare products weren’t working together with the hyaluronic acid, so I did tested different patches on my face and arms to see how the product performed. I used 1 drop in each area and allowed it to dry for 10 min before applying anything on top. The patch without additional product looked as if there was a film on top and when I began rubbing it, it peeled up white “crumbs“ as if a peeling mask was being removed. When I applied moisturizer to the other patches of skin and rubbed it in, almost immediately the product began peel off. The only time I didn’t experience peeling was when I carefully dabbed the moisturizer into my skin but even then, my skin felt tight and uncomfortable and left me wanting to wash my face. In all cases, the product didn’t feel like it sunk in but felt as if it created a barrier on my skin so even if it didn’t peel any products that are applied on top wouldn’t sink into the skin.

I started using this and in just a few days it’s all cleared up and so super soft. A surprising amount of people don’t know how hyaluronic acid works. It takes and holds moisture making it easier for your skin to absorb it. In order for it to do this it needs moisture to begin with. The key to using this serum and any hyaluronic acid product is to apply it to WET skin. If you don’t then it may end up having the opposite effect by taking the moisture out of your skin. I get out of the shower at night and before drying off I apply this to my still moist face (it helps that the hot water already has my pores open). Allow it to air dry and then apply your moisturizers or oils over it. It will help you absorb your moisturizers and oils better as well.

If you’re someone who needs hydration for your skin, a hyaluronic acid serum like this one would be a great addition to your routine. Hyaluronic acid is one of the (if not THE) best ingredients out there when it comes to attracting moisture from the atmosphere to your skin. The best way to use this is to apply it onto a face that isn’t completely dry, then follow up with a moisturizer in order to lock that moisture in. Of course, if you have other skincare concerns, just using this serum won’t be enough to solve everything for you, and you’ll have to layer your other products in addition to your hyaluronic acid. It might be smarter to just buy another product that contains hyaluronic acid as well as other ingredients you need — this would decrease the number of layers you’d have to do, which is preferable. The only thing I’m not a huge fan of is the texture. It’s a watery gel but something about this serum feels a little slimy. It can even feel slightly sticky at first. I prefer The Ordinary’s Marine Hyaluronics much more. That product has a straight up watery texture (it literally feels like you’re putting water on your face) and is therefore much thinner and lighter in consistency, which makes it more ideal for layering.

After years of doing unspeakable things to rid my skin of acne, I destroyed my skin’s natural moisture barrier, leaving me with very dry skin (a fair warning to those acne prone ladies and gents, don’t use harsh soaps and physical exfoliates!  They will damage your skin and can actually make acne worse). After trying several different expensive moisturizers whose fragrance irritated my tired skin, I discovered The Ordinary. Out of all of the products in the line I’ve tried, this has made the single biggest difference in my skin! My skin is glowing and has regained its youthful appearance! I am super cautious to claim that any one product can fix your skin, because let’s face it, that is an advertising ploy meant to lure you into buying more unnecessary products. BUT! There is reason this is used in so many face care products as a featured ingredient. Hyaluronic acid is a naturally occurring substance in the skin that draws and locks in moisture from the environment. Unfortunately your skin produces less as you age. Many derma fillers are made using hyaluronic acid to help smooth fine lines and wrinkles. Syrums like this use molecules too large to really sink into the skin and rather sit on top as a surface barrier (still very important!) If you live in a dry environment, this may not be super effective, as there is no moisture to draw in to the skin and instead, it may draw moisture out of the deep layers of the skin. This can be helped by using other acids in your evening routine that target the deeper layers of your skin. I also highly suggest pairing this with a thicker moisturizer on top, as this is meant to mimic your skin’s water barrier. You only need a small amount of this to spread a thin layer over the skin.

The serum has no scent.  The texture is viscuous and a little slimy (like the Korean snail mucous serums) but that’s what seals the moisture in your skin.  I find it works best to apply my moisturizer immediately after the serum.  They kind of blend together to create the perfect moisture veil.  I would recommend 5-10 minutes before applying foundation when using this product.  I don’t wear foundation but when I apply tinted moisturizer I’ve never had a problem with pilling when I use this product.,Great product for plump youthful skin,light,blue,dry,brown,P427419,Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5 Hydrating Serum,The Ordinary,15.7
