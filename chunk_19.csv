If you are not using some form of hyaluronic by the age of 30 and need to plump your skin up, buy this now!

I transitioned from a much more expensive hydrating serum to this one (along with the niacinamide one by The Ordinary). The formula is less cosmetically elegant (it’s a little sticky) but my skin stayed the same as when I was using the $30  serum. At the end of December, I ran out, and decided not to repurchase for the second time since I wasn’t sure how much this product was doing. BIG. MISTAKE. Since then, my skin has gotten way worse. More closed comedones, oilier, more visible fine lines (I’m only 21!), and even cystic acne, which I never get. I tried compensating with other hydrating products, but my skin never really bounced back. Well, finally bit the bullet and repurchased this, and within a few days, my skin has changed dramatically. The little fine line I had? Gone. Oiliness? Better. Acne? Clearing up with no new pimples on the way. So, essentially, this is my holy grail serum and I am never giving it up again.I truly think everyone could benefit from adding this to their routine, not just those with dry skin. Many acne or anti-aging treatments can be irritating or drying (I’m looking at you, acids and retinol), but this product can help balance the negative effects out. It plumps skin up. It can reduce oiliness and balance skin by adding hydration. It soothes dry and irritated zits. You really can’t overdo it or harm yourself with this product, plus it’s only $7.

Just make sure to follow it up with something hydrating, like an essence, mist, or moisturizer, so that the acid has some hydration to pull into the skin. Otherwise, if you’re in a dry climate, it’ll pull hydration from the deeper layers of the skin.

So when I used this winter was on its way and I needed more moisture in my life. Hyaluronic acid is supposed to be really good at helping the skin retain moisture by attracting water to the skin. Unfortunately I didn’t notice a huge difference. I tried using it different ways, changing up when it was used in my skincare routine. Everything was just meh. However, I feel like when I mixed it in with a very water moisturizer it helped my skin really soak in the moisture. Also, it can be a bit tacky after application. Layering my hydrators and moisturizers didn’t cause much of a problem and the feeling mostly went away, but I know some people just don’t like the feeling.

I’m 34 and have never used anti-aging products. My skincare has always focused on acne, dark spots, and pore treatments. I have combination skin so I get excessively oily on my T-zone. The sample size I received was only good for 1 day of use (morning and evening) so I cannot attest to their claims, however, I can talk about how well the product did on my skin. I applied the Bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum after cleaning and toning my face in the morning and I applied my gel moisturizer after the serum absorbed into my skin. The absorption was pretty quick which I really liked because that meant that I didn’t have to waste so much time before applying my gel moisturizer. Once the Bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum absorbed, I noticed my skin was really soft and smooth. I went about my did and did not experience the T-zone shine I normally have which meant this was a product I could use because it wouldn’t make me feel extra oily. My evening application was the same I applied it after cleansing and toning the serum absorbed fairly quickly and then I applied my gel moisturizer. I woke up the next morning and my skin was again nice and soft. I give this four stars based on the experience I was able to have with the serum I will have to reassess my review after trying the Bareminerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum for the full 4 weeks, which is when their study claims to have shown results.","Absorbs well, leave skin soft and smooth with no s",deep,brown,combination,black,P460779,Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Anti-Aging Face Serum,bareMinerals,65.0

I didn’t quite know what to expect with this serum but was immediately intrigued when I saw that they incorporated  Long Life Herb, a superfood from Japan, & Niacinamide, into the formula. I also liked that the serum was vegan, clean and cruelty-free.  Unlike my other serums, the  main difference  I noticed immediately was it said in order to see optimal results, you would have to use it twice daily for four weeks. The first time I used this serum was in the morning, during my normal skin care routine. I used it after cleansing like the instructions said. I liked the texture and smell of this serum. The milky white consistency was not too thick and not too watery. The serum blended into the skin easily. There was a very, very, LIGHT fragrance that disappeared immediately after I applied it which I liked  despite not  liking fragranced products on my face. The serum dried slightly  tacky which I also liked. After it was completely dry I did notice a slight glow to my skin which I  really liked as well .Because I have oily skin, I usually am not a fan of products that  leave a glow or sheen-like effect, however I liked the fact that this serum was completely dry and my skin looked glowy versus actually being glowy.  The second day  I used this serum  I decided instead to use it after cleansing and moisturizing my face and used it in place of primer due to the tackiness. Again, because of my skin texture and type, I prefer a primer  that has  more of a tacky  feel to the skin as I find that my foundation sticks better, however I didn’t notice much of a difference. In terms of using it at night it had the same effects as it did in my morning routine. I’m excited to see how this serum  holds up to its claims* and how it effects my skin within the next four weeks.","So Far, So Good",deep,brown,oily,black,P460779,Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Anti-Aging Face Serum,bareMinerals,65.0

I don’t find anything wrong with the age I am right now, thank you very much. I do have dry skin, though, and funnily enough, this works great for that. Straight out of the bottle, I detected no smell. When I began applying it, it started to smell minty ... which then morphed into something citrusy. (“What shape-shifting magic is this?!“ I wondered.) I feel marketing the Skinlongevity serum as a moisturizer would perhaps be more straightforward. It absorbs into the skin quickly, and leaves my normally dry skin feeling super soft and hydrated. The only negative is my T-zone starts to feel a little oily as the day goes on, and I would prefer my skin feeling hydrated and healthy without the addition of some oiliness.

After using it for about a month now, I’m not sure there is any good change that happened to my skin. I really like that there is niacinamide which is an ingredient that I adore but I’m not sure that long life herb is something that has enough research yet to prove that it is beneficial to the skin. In terms of packaging, I like the glass jar, since it’s recyclable and environmentally friendly. However, with the pump, it’s a little hard to use sometimes. Often, the first pump will be too powerful and cause a small mess.

The fact that this has plant extract actives and isn’t an acid like vitamin C really intrigued me. So, on to usage experience. It’s a gel cream consistency, not too thick or thin. On my skin, it absorbs really nicely, and isn’t sticky or weirdly smooth like things full of silicones. A week into using it, I definitely felt more plump and glowy. Just brighter and healthy. The hydrated plumpness definitely softened fine lines on my 40 year old skin. I don’t know if it’s actually reducing them, but I look fresher and brighter.

This new serum is boosted with Long Life Herb, a mineral-rich and skin-strengthening superfood, responsibly harvested from Okinawa, Japan.

All are pretty high on the list too! This all-in-one is perfect when I don’t have the time to use two or three single-ingredient products.  A heads-up for those with sensitive skin - this has alcohol and fragrance so this may not be for you.  Both do not bother me, in fact some of my HG products have them (hello Sulwhasoo). I love the texture and scent of this serum. My skin didn’t get dull or irritated when I dropped my other serums and switched to this.

I used this product for 3-1/2 - 4 weeks so I could give an honest and thorough review. This is a serum that’s a bit on the watery side but not unexpected since serums are notably thinner. Skin Longevity is cultivated with the Long Life Herb from Okinawa, Japan. The scent to me smells like a fresh lemon mixed with the scent of a spring rain. After a week and a half, I noticed how incredibly soft and smooth my skin felt. The texture of my skin continued to get better over the next two weeks. As far as wrinkles, I didn’t have any “wow” results but I wasn’t really expecting to see a huge difference. When I read the clinical studies, it showed a 23-25% improvement in wrinkles and fine lines. This to me is a realistic expectation and something I can believe. I appreciate any company that doesn’t inflate result findings to mislead the consumer especially when it comes to skincare products. Overall, I like this product and think it’s great if you want to improve the texture of your skin and minimize pores.

Made me break out real bad and also seems to have misleading branding. -- I love the clean, vegan formula of the serum. It’s awesome to see this is become more of a norm and that this product is pushing that norm further in a positive direction.- I’m fairly skeptical of the “boosted long life herb” (aka coastal hog fennel) inclusion. The claim is that because people who live long lives in Okinawa eat coastal hog fennel, it’s somehow going to have anti-aging skin benefits. A quick google search on the plant only shows benefits of increased glucose metabolism when consumed. Even then, these sources aren’t on their face actually from peer-reviewed scientific work. Looking at the serum as a whole, I’m pretty sure the “long life herb” is just a marketing ploy for an otherwise run of the mill anti-aging serum.- The bottle looks nice but the cap seems to be a little small, so it can be tricky to open and close the bottle easily.- The serum is lightly scented with an airy, vaguely floral scent. It’s not overpowering at all and smells fresh. I really like it.- The serum feels a lot thinner, more liquid than others I have used.- Two pumps was about right to cover my face and neck.- Some other serums I’ve used have an instant, fresh feeling on my skin. I didn’t have that reaction with this serum.- No sticky, heavy or otherwise uncomfortable feeling. The serum seemed to seep into my skin fairly quickly. - After about a week of use, I broke out all over my cheeks and neck. Nothing else in my skin care routine or lifestyle changed.- I kept this product in rotation for about a month hoping my skin would just adjust, but it never did.

I have an established skincare routine that has worked well for the several years. I have combination/oily skin that easily develops milia. Usually, anytime I’ve added something new to my routine, my skin would break out in a rash, develop acne, or more milia. I would use a product for at least a couple weeks as well. Therefore, I was hesitant, but excited to try this. I am delighted to say that this serum was a great addition to my skincare routine! All of the serums I use are applied at night as they don’t usually sit well under make up. The instructions indicated that this may be used in the morning as well, so I incorporated it into my morning routine before make up.  I’ve been using this product for about one month now. During my first use, I noticed a faint refreshing scent and the consistency was thinner than what I’m used to. Two pumps is a little excessive  for my face, so one and a half has worked perfectly. This serum lays very nicely under make up as it absorbs quickly and doesn’t cause any face make up to skip or become patchy. Milia primarily develops on my forehead. I noticed the milia bumps disappearing more quickly. My skin feels more hydrated without excess oil. In the summer, my forehead gets quite a bit more sun that the rest of my face. This serum has helped maintain an even tone. Overall, there is an increased glow, radiance, and smoothness to my skin.

I chose to be all natural so that I can follow up in four weeks for an accurate before and after comparison photo). I know it’s supposed to take about 4 weeks before one sees a difference in their skin’s appearance but I immediately felt a difference after the first day! My skin felt so smooth and soft! I couldn’t stop running my hands across my smooth face. I was amazed! The serum contains Niacinamide and the Long Life Herb, which I truly believe has to be very potent. The long life herb is a skin-strengthening superfood that resists visible signs of aging! The herb contains more vitamins and minerals than spinach and  kale! The serum has a very light, silky, gelatinous, clean feel to it. When I applied the serum after cleansing, my skin absorbed this beautiful serum like it was so thirsty and drank it all in. My skin’s appearance looks healthy, not shiny but with a wonderful veil of light moisture. I can’t stress enough how beautiful it feels on your face and neck. After applying 2 pumps as instructed, I applied it to my face first then applied it up my neck in upward strokes to defy gravity. I still had enough product to spread some on my chest and the back of my hands. The product spreads very well and a little goes a long way. The scent is a very nice, faint citrusy smell which is invigorating to me. The scent is all natural, it contains no synthetic fragrances which I truly appreciate. I felt so good knowing I used a clean formula that’s vegan, fragrance, and cruelty free. By the way, for reference: I am 46 years old, have always slept in my makeup, worshiped the sun my entire life, and never used sunscreen so I have lots of hyperpigmentation.

Basically from the list this serum is a $62 Niacinamide, Vitamin C (derivative) & Squalane serum, but most people know you can get that at a MUCH cheaper cost, they throw in a fancy herb into it to raise the price. Plus, the stuff smells like floor cleaner and is LOADED with fragrance (there are 4 different types if you are sensitive to that type of thing)After all that why am I still mixed in my feelings? I have been testing this for about a week and my skin does look a little better, I will give it that. But I would not repurchase this product or recommend it to someone. Yes, it has some great base ingredients, but with the high price tag and tons, I mean TONS of fragrance and all the wonderful options out there for good affordable skincare...this is a definite pass.","Mixed feeling, but pretty much a pass",fair,blue,dry,red,P460779,Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Anti-Aging Face Serum,bareMinerals,65.0

One, I am not sure why I was chosen for an anti-aging serum because I am 18 (but i suppose it is never to early to take care of your skin). I used this product each night and morning after washing my face and applying Bliss Vitamin c+ tri-peptide moisturizer and Differin gel. I am unsure if it was just the combination of products I was using or if my skin just did not like this serum, but I instantly broke out after starting use of this product. I used it for two weeks consistently, hoping that my acne was just a hormonal problem. I eventually stopped using it and my skin has cleared up since. I do not have sensitive skin and normally don’t react to even the harshest of products. I have combo skin with an oily T zone and my chin and center of my forehead broke out most from this product.

This BareMinerals Skinlongevity Long Life Herb Serum is a liquid - it’s runny. It glides easily onto the skin and absorbs quickly. My skin feels sticky for a little while after application but that eventually goes away. I have not yet used it under makeup but I imagine this would be a nice primer due to that sticky effect. My skin is noticeably smoother throughout the day. Have I noticed a change in fine lines or brightness? No. Skin care takes time! But I like this enough to continue my testing of it over the next 6-8 weeks. I LOVE serums. Way more than normal moisturizers.

I will update my thoughts after a month of twice daily wear. This is a thin whitish liquid with mild floral scent. Even though it advertises as “synthetic fragrance free“  there’s definitely plenty of smell, with at least 4 ingredients being fragrance. However, the majority of the top ingredients are potentially helpful for the skin, niacinamide, saccharomyces, squalane and glycerin are the most notable. There are many herbal extracts as well. The product soaks in the skin very rapidly, allowing for additional creams, makeup and finishing oils to absorb. There’s no issues with makeup or my normal skincare sitting on top of the serum. No difference in makeup longevity. My skin tolerated this product very well even around the delicate eye area. I haven’t noticed much skin changes, but it’s only been a week.

One and a half to two pumps is more than enough for my face and it absorbs quickly into the skin but leaves it feeling hydrated before I put on my moisturizer. It also has been wearing nicely under makeup. The only thing I would change about it so far is to just maybe reduce some of the fragrant components used. It doesn’t add much to the experience for me personally and can be sensitizing sometimes! However I have experienced no irritation thus far personally. Also: the packaging is sooo pretty but sometimes when I take the cap off, it sometimes takes the pump underneath it off a little too since it is a nice tight fit.

I don’t enjoy feeling something sit on my lips, and I don’t want to worry about perfectly reapplying something once it fades. I also don’t enjoy “milky,” tingling, or shimmery lip products. I struggle to find a product that avoids all of these things. The lip glowy balms, however, live up to my picky standards!They have the perfect liquid lip balm texture! They give me a nourishing, cushiony feeling on the lips without being heavy or sticky. I never feel them unless I rub my lips together. They give my lips a glossy appearance and fill in my lip lines without being a lip plumping/tingling product. They also give a perfectly sheer, non-milky and non-shimmery tint that lasts for a decent time on the lips. Once they fade away, they sink in like a normal lip balm would. They don’t leave behind a weird residue that other similar formulas often do. Reapplication is therefore super easy and unproblematic! I have all five flavors/shades and I truly use every one of them! I typically use Berry (pink tint), Grapefruit (pinky-orange tint), Peach (orange tint), or Gummy Bear (lavender tint) when I wear makeup, while I wear Pear (clear) at any time. (I think that Laneige is discontinuing Pear, so I stocked up on it from the Laneige website directly. I’m heartbroken!)Each scent is perfectly fruity/juicy, fresh, and subtle. The scent also fades away after application, so there is no worry about headaches. The tints are all beautiful, but they are quite similar, so you don’t need every one. The packaging is also perfect. It has a smooth, mess-free applicator that can be used to apply the product directly to the lips. The colors of the tubes match the flavor/scent, and the tubes themselves are standard and functional.

The original lip sleeping mask has a tiny spatula which is cute but is inconvenient and unsanitary to store when not in use. This is not quite as thick as the original and is more akin to a gloss. It is hydrating and feels good on dry lips, but it disappears quicker than the original and doesn’t have quite as much cling on the lips. Because of that, I feel like I have to reapply more often. I do really like the grapefruit flavor, but I love grapefruit flavoring to begin with. Overall, it’s a good product that I would recommend if you are looking for a hydrating gloss.

However, it must be noted that this is not a “balm“ or a sleeping mask, so if you’re looking for the exact formulation of the sleeping mask you won’t find that in this product. This is the perfect cross between a lip balm and a lip gloss. It has that glossy finish without an overly sticky feeling while also giving the moisturizing effects of a lip balm (instead of just delivering a shine from a gloss). I think this mix is perfect and I love that laneige lip products finally come in a tube which make using it so much more convenient than having to dip you finger directly into the lip sleeping mask. I keep one of these in my purse at all times as a staple lip product and I real enjoy it. The berry and peach scent are my favorites but I can’t wait to try out the grapefruit as well. Whenever a sale rolls around I always stock up on at least 2-3 of these. For a colorless lip product with a great scent: this is definitely one of my go-to’s. The Bad: Performance wise, there’s not really anything that comes to mind which is “bad“ about this product. The Ugly/Honest: This product is expensive for what it is. I own higher end lip products but let me explain... The lip sleeping mask is 0.7oz and costs $22 while this is only 0.35oz and costs $17. That’s half the product of the sleeping mask at only a $5 discount. The formulation of these two products has to be extremely similar and the sleeping mask packaging is much more luxurious than this basic lip balm tube. I love this product, but in reality it should be a few dollars cheaper. For how much of this you will go through by using it as a balm or a gloss topper, you’ll be shelling out a pretty penny to keep stock of this product (welcome to the club).",,light,hazel,combination,brown,P443563,Lip Glowy Balm,LANEIGE,18.0

My lips get dry/chapped periodically throughout the year, especially in the summer and winter. This heals my lips very very fast. It’s a thicker formula, but I don’t find it uncomfortable/incredibly sticky. It’s a very luxe feeling lip balm. I think the biggest positive to this is it lasts me FOREVER!!! I use lip balm almost daily, and I usually apply more than once. This stuff takes me MONTHS to get through. My first tube lasted me about eight months, so I can definitely justify the price tag!

I’ve been wanting to try this product for awhile because I got a sample of the sleep mask in the apple scent and was absolutely head over heels for it. Last year I bought four tubes of the Bite agave lip mask prior to their reformulation which is the reason why I have pushed off buying the Laneige lip balm.

I’ve found that the lip sleep mask and the lip balm have very similar consistency and lasting power. I have applied the lip balm prior to going to bed and still wake up with it on my lips (I also had the same experience with the sleep mask but not with the old formula bite beauty lip agave mask). In the end, if you’ve been wanting to try the sleep mask but have been apprehensive just get this lip balm.

In all honesty this works better for me than Laneige’s lip mask (the jar) since it’s more moisturizing, and still occlusive enough.

It’s still incredibly hydrating, not as thick or sticky, but still has a great consistency that doesn’t smudge easily. If you like thicker lip balms/glosses I think you would favor this much more than lip balms such as the fenty beauty lip balm which is thin. The only con is it has no scent. I got the peach scent, and once I applied and smelled it from the tube there was no scent. I had my boyfriend smell it as well, and he agrees there was nothing. I personally like my lip glosses scented so this was a little weird that they even marketed different scents when... there is none.

Naturally, I turned to them when I needed daytime lip hydration. First off, the smell (I chose the green (sheer) pear “flavor/scent“) is divine! I wanted to keep applying it or at least opening it and sniffing it just for the aroma! It’s texture is not very thick or waxy like a balm, more like a gloss, though not sticky, just slick. It does give your lips a glossy look. The only downside, and it was a major downside, was that I felt I needed to continually reapply it; more often than I had been applying my previous lip balm (Lip Service by LUSH). It could be that I had a reaction to one of the ingredients, and in that case it’s a personal issue. But regardless, I feel that for the price, the product should last longer or there should be more of it. Long story short, if you’re wanting a delicious smelling lip gloss, then I highly recommend going with this! If, however, you’re looking for a hydrating balm, I’d look elsewhere. (I’ve heard of others applying a thin layer of the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask during the day, I have yet to try it, but I would guess it yields better lip hydration/protection than the Lip Glowy Balm).",Smells Delicioso; Hydration Only So-So,porcelain,hazel,combination,blonde,P443563,Lip Glowy Balm,LANEIGE,18.0

Opinions are my own.If you’ve used the lip sleeping mask, this product is somewhat similar in scent. Not as much strawberry candy scent as the original lip sleeping mask, but the berry balm is close. I tried the others in store and found I liked the pear scent a lot more than this one, and I definitely prefer the lip sleeping mask scents to the glowy balms.It comes out somewhat thick but immediately melts onto the lips comfortably. Its not very sticky, which I like. I am not a gloss fan, but this was okay for me.What disappointed me is its lasting power. This absorbed far too quickly for my liking, and I sort of felt like my lips were a little oily when it became remnants.

I just don’t believe it’s worth $15. Especially since you can get the lip sleeping mask (which I use during the day and at night) for $20 and you get way more product.

I actually hated it the first couple times I tried it but it turns out I was using it completely wrong. I had never used a lipgloss that needed to be squeezed out of a bottle, so I wasn’t applying enough product. Be generous and the results will be totally worth it! This product does exactly what it says it does, it softens and nourishes your lips. I have had unusually chapped lips lately and this gloss does a better job at concealing and healing than chapstick does. I honestly think it also makes my lips look/feel more plump than usual.Despite applying a generous amount of product, I still have quite a bit left in my tube even after 10  uses. I don’t think I’ve used even half of it so that is a good sign. I’ve also noticed that the more I use this product, the more I like it. It really grew on me. I typically wear it right on top of my natural lips or on top of a chapstick. It has a very subtle pink tint to it, but pretty much matches my natural lip color. The “flavor” is berry but it doesn’t have a taste at all. I tried liking it off my lips a few different times and couldn’t taste anything. That being said, it does have a berry scent that I really like. It’s not strong, but definitely noticeable when you put it on. I love the packaging because it is so easy to travel with! It’s only 2-3 inches long so it easily fits in pockets or tiny purses. It’s basically the same size as any ordinary chapstick. I think this is one of my favorite lipglosses I have ever tried. I wear chapstick religiously but I may start wearing this product instead because I truly believe this product provided more impressive results. I also love that it is an easy tool for me to instantly look more put together and full of life without having to worry about looking too dressed up or getting lipstick stains on everything. *I received this product for free for testing purposes.*",Better than Chapstick,lightMedium,brown,combination,brown,P443563,Lip Glowy Balm,LANEIGE,18.0

Ever since I had a nasty reaction to Bite Beauty’s Agave Lip Mask, the only thing I’ve been able to put on my lips without them looking like a lip-injection-gone-wrong has been Vaseline. I love my Vaseline but it doesn’t exactly MOISTURIZE the lips, it just kinda creates a barrier on them which keeps them from being chapped but then I find myself constantly needing to reapply it in order for my lips to not feel dry. Through comparing ingredients, I’m suspecting beeswax as the culprit to my breakouts, and you’d probably be surprised by just how many lip products have beeswax in them! I found this Laneige Lip Glowy Balm, checked the ingredients (beeswax-free) and decided to give it a shot. It’s incredible. It’s sort of like lip gloss meets lip balm. It’s great to apply with a simple everyday look and really does feel nourishing. After using it daily for about a week I even feel like I don’t constantly need to have something on my lips anymore.You do need to reapply after little while if you want it to stay glossy, depending how much you talk/eat/fidget with your lips like I do, but I don’t mind that since I find that even after the glossiness wears off I can still feel the product on my lips if that makes sense.

Though, my first impression coincides with all the following ones – this product is amazing! The balm comes in a cute squeezable tube in the color that matches the scent. It’s available in four different flavors. I got mine in Berry and it smells delicious! It reminds of candy or soda – sweet and mouthwatering. Besides, the smell lasts on the lips for some time and it even makes the breath fresher. The beveled applicator allows making precise application and touch-ups on the go. The formula is quite thick but non-sticky. It glides smoothly on my lips and leaves a high-gloss finish. Also, I’ve noticed a cooling effect, which is quite nice. Surprisingly, staying power exceeds what I’d expect for a balm. Although after eating/drinking it requires reapplication, it still looks quite presentable. The balm doesn’t migrate into the surrounding lip area, it just fades away delicately without leaving any flakes or white lines. After application, the fine lines become less visible and the chaps ache less and in the aftermath, heal. It looks as if the balm kind of seals the lips. I believe in this way, it locks in moisture. Its hydrating formula gives a long-lasting effect, so my lips look and feel soft, hydrated and smooth not only right after the use of the balm but for a while longer. Moreover, the LANEIGE Balm protects lips from such weather elements as cold, heat and wind.As this is a color-saturated lip balm with a glossy finish, it gives the illusion of plumper and more kissable lips. It will suit and flatter any skin tone and ambiance. It can be used as a primer to prep the lips for smoother and more even lipstick application and as a topper to add a glossy finish to the lip color.

187784,23020655221,3,1.0,,0,0,0,2019-05-02,"TLDR: TRY IT. Laneige describes Lip Glowy Balm as a lightweight balm. In my opinion, though, the balm was goopy like a gloss. However, at times, I forgot I was wearing anything so there’s that.The balm has about 24 ingredients in common with the Lip Sleeping Mask. The main difference is the texture: one is a gloss and the other is a balm. Both have attractive feels and finishes, though. In order to make the claim that Lip Glowy Balm was Lip Sleeping Mask’s daytime complement, I’d have liked to see an SPF rating for the product. Moving on, the balm is housed in a squeeze tube that provides decent control of the product. The first ingredient is hydrogenated polyisobutene which can soften skin and provide shine without being tacky/sticky. I found this to be the case. The balm also includes carnauba wax, candelilla wax, Dimethicone, etc. which are great ingredients for sealing moisture, but still nothing exceptional. The formula also includes fragrance. Personally, I don’t mind the fragrance/ flavor, but I’ve read too many articles cautioning against products that include it to give this five stars with its inclusion.I found myself using the product as a stand-alone gloss. The formula formed what felt like a cushiony, protective layer between my lips and the environment. The finish wasn’t sticky/tacky nor did it bleed. And although I was skeptical at first, the sheer, barely-there peach color is very attractive and I could see the color working on a variety of skin tones. I loved the way my lips looked with this on and the way they felt afterward. My male friends paid me many compliments.Application tip: the packaging is a little stiff, but if you gently squeeze while rubbing the applicator on your lips, you can limit the amount of product that comes out. It’s also helpful that the applicator is see-through and the gloss has a tint to it. A little goes a long way!

I’m the type of person that hates lipgloss so I thought I was gonna end up having to return it until I applied it. It’s very light weight & hydrating, I wear it both during the day & at night before bed & it leaves my lips super soft & moisturized which is why I had to run out & buy the pear scent which I ended up living even more just cause of the scent alone!

The consistency of this formula is more on the smooth and moisturizing side, and I actually enjoyed using this gloss because of that. The fragrance/flavor is a very light and fresh fruity berry that is not nauseating or synthetic smelling, which I really appreciate. The gloss itself gives your lips a natural berry pink color, and leaves them feeling hydrated and looking healthy and shiny without glueing your hair to lips if it’s slightly breezy outside.

The peach one has almost zero scent which I didn’t expect. I thought it d actually be pretty heavy scented and if I read the reviews I would have know that. With that being said, I am actually ok with it being barely scented. The main thing for me that the balm feels amazing. It s glossy and has thicker consistency but not goopy. It is not sticky and feels great. It stays on and keeps my lips very comfortably moisturized. Highly recommend. I do have the overnight mask in berry and the green one I use religiously every night.

I was hyped to receive this newbie lip product, which was described as the daytime version of the lip mask. I received the Grapefruit flavor, which claims to have a coral tint to it. I’ve been using this everyday since receiving it about a week and a half ago, and I have mixed feelings. It does provide a very slight, and I mean slight lip tint, but nothing coral, at least on my lips. This definitely is not enough for me to use alone. It just doesn’t provide enough hydration to last me that long before having to apply another layer. I can say though the scent is amazing, really enjoy how this smells. And I also prefer this as a lip topper rather than a chapstick. I use Mac lipliner for my everyday lip color and adding this on top helps the liner not appear as dry as it would alone.

188584,36967193185,4,1.0,1.0,10,0,10,2022-05-20,"TLDR at the end! Long review incoming!Let me start by saying I have the driest lips of anybody I know. They get so dry that sometimes my top lip literally loses feeling because it’s just a layer of dead or dehydrated skin. I have tried probably 80 different brands in the last few years trying to find a balm that works to hydrate these languished lips without also breaking out the area around my mouth (particularly when I was wearing a mask constantly, but also because I’m a Face Sleeper™.) This balm works wonders for me. It’s the best thing I’ve used in years. The *scent* is really beautiful and the finish is fine, although I’d prefer if it was slightly glossier (but that’s a nitpick.)The reason I believe this isn’t quite a holy grail is because the sunscreen taste is absolutely undeniable. A lot of other reviews mention that it isn’t bad, which is curious to me because I find it approaching a level I consider to be overwhelming. It’s also especially curious because you can’t SMELL it! It’s only in the taste. However, I still absolutely recommend it if you have dry lips that nothing seems to work on. This really has made me feel so much more confident not having a Crusty Lip™ TLDR: if you don’t mind a pretty strong sunscreen taste, this is literally the best lip balm I’ve ever used as far as functionality is concerned.","Approaching Holy Grail, but Sunscreen Taste",light,green,combination,brown,P12573,Intense Therapy Lip Balm SPF 25,Jack Black,10.0

I’m also ridiculously susceptible to packaging: Sleek tubes, doe-footed wands, maybe even shimmer.I never would have gravitated toward this line, but after another product left my lips dry and peeling, I started researching, and Jack Black’s lip balms were highly recommended. I ordered the Natural Mint and loved it -- it’s soothing, but not greasy; the smell is pleasant but fades almost immediately, so it’s unobtrusive.

It hurt to smile and talk and laughing was out of the question so of course I went on a mission to rehydrate my lips. I went out and bought around 6 different popular lip balms which I tried for various amounts of time to no avail. I got recommendations from friends, took to the internet- no luck. I don’t remember how I came across this product, probably a YouTube video or something, but I do remember using it for the first time. I put it on right before falling asleep, woke up 4 hours later for work and my lips were.. normal. Not crusty or dry or cracked or bleeding, they were hydrated and supple. The only “downside” to this balm is the dry skin on my lips plump up in the matter of an hour and it looks gross so I have to exfoliate it gently away(i just use a damp washcloth and very light pressure, it doesn’t take a lot of work at all) I am still using it to this day. I swear by this product and recommend it to people all the time. Of course I have tried other lip products in the last 5 years but I always come back to Jack Black and I always have a back up somewhere. My favorite flavor is the mint- especially right after I have showered and brushed my teeth because it makes me feel so nice and clean. The other ones are really nice too. I appreciate the sun protection as well so I don’t have to worry about premature aging on my lips. Seriously, if you’re on the fence about buying this, just do it.

This time, I got the black tea and blackberry, and really like the scent. It does NOT have a super heavy fragrance that irritates my skin, which I appreciate! It glides on so nicely, and feels really comfortable (plus spf protection!). My lips have felt amazing after going back to this! They were constantly chapped and peeling, but I made some changes, and they feel great now! I stopped using toothpaste with harmful, drying ingredients and I think the lanolin in this balm was the icing on the cake! It’s so hard to find balms with lanolin, so I’m so glad I did (because it really is a miracle worker). The only reason I gave 4 stars, is because I was disappointed in the size (my fault for not checking before purchasing online). This tube was (literally) half the size of the balms I usually purchase (rosebud salve in a tube, kiehl’s balm, etc), for about the same price (it does work better though). When I first purchased online, I thought the price was great, but when I realized how small this actually was, I was disappointed (again, this was my fault for not noticing the .25 oz). A little bit does go a long way though, and since I’ve had success with this balm, I will repurchase.

None of them actually HEAL, though. I saw this at Sephora and thought I’d give it a go since I saw it came in various flavours and has one of the highest SPFs I’ve seen in a balm. I grabbed the Shea and Black Tea. I just came off an airplane and my lips were dry and peeling. I applied this and it healed them immediately. I went back for another Shea and the Grapefruit the next day. I wish the Vanilla was available! I’ve thrown out many of my balms as nothing even comes close to comparing to this stuff. My lips have quite literally never felt better. I will happily order 10 next time. FYI, the scents dissipate quickly after applying - there’s not much difference between the Shea, Grapefruit and Black Tea.

I got a sample of the natural mint flavor and my lips feel silky as ever.I don’t really notice when it wears off because even when it dries my lips still feel moist despite this dry winter air.

My fiancé is constantly buying cheap drugstore lip balms and losing them. I figured I’d pick up a few of these for him so he has one in the truck, at home, & work. He loves them!! Black tea is his favorite, of course I had to try it myself too and they leave the lips moisturized, soft, & protected (SPF).",Fiancé loves it,,,,,P12573,Intense Therapy Lip Balm SPF 25,Jack Black,10.0

I got the Blackberry scent thinking it would be the most appealing, but found it initially off-putting, like something wasn’t quite right about it. The balm does its job as far as moisturizing without being especially goopy, though it requires more frequent reapplications than Malin + Goetz mojito lip balm (another, more expensive favorite).",Moisturizing but mildly funky,,,oily,,P12573,Intense Therapy Lip Balm SPF 25,Jack Black,10.0

It’s not greasy or oily and actually makes your lips feel better in no time at all. A single application of Jack Black will keep my lips hydrated for several hours, which is saying a lot since most just seem to sit on the lips. I found myself reaching for it frequently, and have thrown away most chapsticks/blams since discovering this and keep one in my purse, one on my nightstand, one in my work desk and one on my makeup vanity. I also like the containers these balms come in and have had no problem. The Lemon Chamomile is by far my favorite, followed by Natural Mint and then Grapefruit Ginger.","Best Balm, Bar None",,,combination,,P12573,Intense Therapy Lip Balm SPF 25,Jack Black,10.0

I’m so glad I did because it completely transformed my lips and now I don’t even really need lip balm.
